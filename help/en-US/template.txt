 Managing Template

 In the [template] directory you can find a folder
 named [module] containing folders for single template-files 
 to be used in x64lab.

 at the moment i write x64lab manages only text utf-8-no-BOM files.
 in future version i will add capabilities to manage projects,
 workspaces,fragments and binary files.

 Bare-Module Templates are templates of one single file.

 - How to add a template and use it.

   1) from the Multipurpose plugin select "Ready Templates"
      in the combobox. a list of folders appears below in the listview.
      by default you will find two folders in it.

      - "module\arm"
      - "module\assembly32"

   2) click on "module\assembly32" listed there.
      you will have just in the base listview of modules
      the following files:

        - 32bit_console.asm
        - blank_main.asm
        - blank_main.inc
        - help.txt

   3) to use "32bit_console.asm" as template drag the item
      and drop it on the "Open documents" plugin. an "untitled-filename"
      will be added in "Open documents". the file has been opened to be modified.
      after modification, save it giving a name and a path
