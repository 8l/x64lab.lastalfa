 Developer Tools.

  The Edit|"Developer tools" menu allows developer to add
  favourites tools or frequently used documentation-files
  to a customized group in order to simplify and make faster
  access to their contents. Every tool, executable or
  simple text file belongs to a group. All informations
  for groups and items are stored in the [config\devtool.utf8]
